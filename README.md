# notetaker-ractive

After finishing one of the great egghead.io's [ReactJS](http://facebook.github.io/react/) tutorials, [Notetaker](https://egghead.io/series/build-your-first-react-js-application), 
I wanted to implement that little App with [RactiveJS](http://www.ractivejs.org/).

The goal is to build a similar tutorial using Ractive instead of React.
